You are playing “pong” (table tennis) against an unbeatable CPU, you are trying to get the highest score possible against it. The score is calculated from how many times you are successfully able to deflect the ball.


This game is a remix of the popular game “Pong”. It features play against a cpu or a multiplayer version that you can play with your friends. For the cpu version, your score is how many times you can successfully hit the ball with the paddle, and users can toggle between that and traditional mode against their friends.
